People rushed past each other on the crowded sidewalks, their faces illuminated by the light from their smartphones. A street musician played a mournful tune on his guitar, hoping for a few coins from the passersby. In a nearby cafÃ©, a couple sat sipping coffee and chatting animatedly, their laughter blending with the hum of the busy street. As darkness fell, the city came alive with a different energy, a vibrant and unpredictable energy that pulsed through its very streets and buildings.`;
